This module adds OpenSearch 1.1 support to Drupal.

Search queries for all the modules that use hook_search() are available at /opensearch/type/keywords. An OpenSearch description is found at /opensearch/type.

An autodiscovery header is added to all pages for node search, while autodiscovery for other searches is added on the specific subtype pages.
